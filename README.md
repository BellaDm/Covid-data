# Covid-data
In this project weâ€™ll be conducting data analysis based on the public dataset originally sourced from New York Times Github and posted on external data source Kaggle. The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time. This time series data is compiled from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak. The data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020 and contains cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths.
