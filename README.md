Project Brief: COVID 19 Data Analysis USA
Objective
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
Context
In this project we’ll be conducting data analysis based on the public dataset originally sourced from New York Times Github and posted on external data source Kaggle. The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the state and county level, over time. This time series data is compiled from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak. The data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020 and contains cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths.
Hypothesis
If covid cases data is consistent, the number of ICU beds can be predicted.
Key Questions
•	Identify most vulnerable states by number of people infected per state
•	Define the methodology for calculating covid spread rate by month.
•	Compile research on the spread speed has been increasing by week.
Data Profile
•	Renamed column “FIps” with “county_id”.
•	Replaced blank cells in “Deaths”, “county_id”, “county” columns with Uknown.
•	Confirmed that there are no duplicate items.
•	Data does not contain PII. 
Data Limitations
•	Number of infected by covid-19 people from vulnerable population category was not found on public websites.
Results and Insights
The data shows that mortality rates have remained unchanged in the same states in recent months, which means that future months will also remain unchanged. Since the data is consistent, it can help to count the number of ICU beds needed for the hospitals.
